    You have to first declare a Varaible 
    Then you must assign a Varaible

header files are preprocressor 

CPP are compiled 

Notes for Synax:
 >> is an extraction opration

the const keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant 
this tells the compiler to prevent anything from modifying it
(( read only ))

typedef = reserved keyword used to create an additional name
( alias ) for another data type.
New identifier for an existing type
helps with readability and reduces typos


arithmetic operators = return the result of a specific arithmetic operation( + - * / )

Type conversion = conversion a value of one data type to another
    implicit = automatic
    explicit = precede value with new data type (int)

user input:
    cout << ((insert operator))
    cin << ((extraction operator))


if statements:
if states do something -- if a condition is true - run code
                        if NOT, then - don't run code

Ternary operator ?: == replacement of the if / else statement 
Condition ? expression1 : expression2;

logic Operations
&& == check if two conditions are true
|| == check if at least one of two conditions is true
! = rerses the logical state of its operand
